Action plans:
- Add some error messages
- Add prefix to output files
- Update readme to include installation and running instructions (use example file)


15 September 2023 (meeting with Randy and Baylee)
Overall aims for this project:
1. Implement best practices in python scripting for the package
-- making it modular and adding doc strings: https://github.com/joaks1/python-script-best-practice
-- use an argument parser. It may be easiest to first understand how to pass in an infile as an argument (to understand this, try the following prompt on chatGPT: 'how can I run a python script where I pass the name of the infile as an argument into the script using sys.argv'). After you understand that, try creating an argument parser (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html)
---- The goal is to get something like this to work:
------ python main.py -i Hu_2021_orchids 
-------- The scripts will know that the prefix "Hu_2021_orchids" will have files "Hu_2021_categories" and "Hu_2021_fst". It will then import those, and then use the same prefix to create the outfiles (such as "Hu_2021_orchids_log.txt", along with the other outfiles)
2. Create reader-friendly documentation to run the package
-- line-by-line instructions in the .md file of how to run the package on an empirical dataset
