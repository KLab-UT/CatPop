# GarterSnakeCombinatorics

This software package uses combinatorics to create all possible scenarios of two
population assignments, performs a permutation test for each comparison, and
generates a p-value along with the name of the gene.

# Flow of Data
## The following lists the files used, the functions, and the inputs/outputs.
Please refer to the image below to understand the flow of data through the
program.

The outputs of this program is as follows:

p-value plot

Ecotype comparison of within and between plot

results.txt, which will list all the genes and their related p-values
log.txt, which will contain all the genes with a p-value below .05
