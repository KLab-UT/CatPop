To do this week (3 April 2023):
Create conceptual figure: Vicente and Kasia
Create random data: Baylee, Reagan, Dante, Candice
Create the code diagram showing data flow (for methods): Reagan
Create density plot of p-values from results (see create_density_plot.r): Dante and Candice
Begin creating dot plot of Fst values showing delta fst (only for true scenario): Dante and Candice (Wait for Randy to give sample code)
Begin creating biological application figure (gene names, snake images): Baylee
Start poster file (Google slides): Baylee

Tutorial for reading and writing files: https://github.com/joaks1/python-file-io

^ Use this tutorial to create a file called "log.txt" that reports information from the script runs (instead of printing them to stdout)
The log.txt file should be long and boring, and should just include all of the information for each analysis

You should then have another ouptut file called "results.txt" that reports the p-values for significant loci.
The results.txt file should be short and informative (e.g., for each significant locus [i.e., loci with p-values < 0.05] provide the (1) gene name, (2) true_delta_fst, and (3) p-value)

To do this week:
Check that your true_delta_fst is correct (you can just check this by hand)
Get the analysis to work with a file that contains many loci
Create the log.txt and results.txt files
Add doc strings to the scripts
Start creating the documentation



P.S. Here is a fun tutorial for using the python debugging library:
